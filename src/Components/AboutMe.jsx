				My interest in web devlopment started back in 2020 after graduating in the
				middle of the pandemic. The job market for psychology majors weren't very
				abundant due to the climate of the world. As a result, I wanted to learn a
				new skill that would be challenging and engaging. Intially I learned Python
				from there I learned HTML and CSS. At that point I learned that frontend
				devlopment was what I enjoyed the most. In my recent projects React was my
				framework of choice in conjuction with Javascript, CSS and Node.js.
